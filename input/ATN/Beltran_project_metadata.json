	"title":"Northern Elephant Seal Study, Ano Nuevo Reserve, 2018-2025",
	"abstract":"Professors Dan Costa and Roxanne Beltran, along with their team of graduate students and researchers, instrument northern elephant seals with a variety of biologging instruments (satellite or GPS trackers, time-depth recorders, CTD and fluorometer tags, jaw acceleration, still and video cameras, blood/muscle oxygen sensors, and 3D movement or IMU tags) to study their at-sea behavior, ecology, and physiology. This project focuses on a diverse array of questions ranging from the ontogeny of foraging patterns to the adaptations required to dive as deep as a mile and for as long as nearly two hours. An additional recent focus has been using elephant seals as oceanographers to better map the physical and biological structure of the transition zone at a scale relevant to individual predators.",
	"purpose":"This project aims to better understand the ecology, physiology, and behavior of northern elephant seals by collecting biologging data during their biannual foraging migrations to the north Pacific.",
